      <td>A 2D multi-generational cellular automaton (CA) simulator and visualizer writen in python. It allows you to input custom rules, neighborhoods, and color schemes, and displays the CA in a pygame window. You can use keyboard controls to puase, rewind, and step through the CA evolution.</td>

      <td><a href="https://github.com/ImanariRoll/Productivity">Prod</a></td>
      <td>A collection of scripts to create daily log files, record time spent working on projects, and store the results in a database. Inludes a jupyter notebook analyzing the time-tracking data with pandas/numpy/matplotlib. I'm currently working on a web interface for the time tracker.</td>
