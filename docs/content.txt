<a href="https://github.com/ImanariRoll/RPi">LEDmux</a>
An LED multiplex display, built from components and soldered to a PCB, controlled by a raspberry pi with python. I'm planning to encase the display in resin and run a CA generator on it to make a cool CA lamp. Maybe I could sell these some day? I could be like the kleine bottle guy!
